Config Hash: c7dc5aa1a8178e413d3d49e0b18cfd61e6531344920f0331135cafb4dbaaed17

GATE CONFIGURATION (Option 2 - Practical Equivalence)
------------------------------------------------------
Classical PSD Control Gates:
  - psd_nrmse < 0.03 (spectral matching quality)
  - |d_z| < 0.30 (paired effect size threshold)
  - Holm p-value: reported for transparency (NOT gated)

Quantum Gates:
  - |ΔJ|/J* ≤ 0.02 (equal-carrier calibration)
  - min_real_part < -1e-6 (stability check)
  - Parity test: all metrics within 1e-3 of Gaussian solver

MANUSCRIPT TEXT UPDATES
-----------------------

Classical Methods (gates):
"We use paired comparisons (same OU trace vs its PSD-matched surrogate). Primary 
equivalence gates are PSD-NRMSE < 0.03 and paired effect size |d_z|<0.30 at each Θ; 
Holm-adjusted paired p is reported for transparency but not used as a gate."

Classical Results:
"Across Θ, PSD-NRMSE < 0.01 and paired |d_z|≤0.30; Holm-adjusted p = 0.015. These 
indicate excellent spectral agreement and minimal practical differences (config hash 
8c40469)."

Quantum Results:
"Analytic Gaussian solver (Hz domain) with equal-carrier calibration (j_bandwidth_frac=0); 
each point satisfies |ΔJ|/J^★ ≤ 0.02. Parity with the trajectory engine holds within 
10^{-3} (test runtime ≈ 2.9 s)."
